        <p>On glancing over my notes of the <strong>seventy odd cases</strong> in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.</p>
        <h4>The Events in Question</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>We were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.</li> 
          <li>It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before.</li>
          <li>A promise of secrecy was made at the time.</li>
          <li>It was early in April in the year '83.</li>
